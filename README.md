## What is Google Foobar Challenge?
It is a secret hiring challenge from Google which you get when you match some search behaviour on Google search or their documentations. You are given a prompt and if you accept, you are moved to an online shell where you can request questions and solve them. If you complete the challenge you have a high chance of being contacted by a Google recruiter!
